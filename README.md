# Interview Challenge Walkthroughs

This repo is a collection of interview challenge solutions. It is not just solutions though. Every challenge has; a rewritten description that clarifies the problem, a manual solution, and finally a coded solution (usually in ruby).

There are many collections of challenge solutions but very few places take the effort to explain the solving process that went into each solution. A challenge solution does you no good if you don't know how to get to that solution. Going over coded solutions offers little in the way of learning. Coding challenges are easy to code, they rarely consist of more than a few dozen lines; 99% of the time, 99% of the challenge, of an interview challenge is the figuring out the challenge. If you want to get better at interview challenges you don't need to improve your coding skills, you need to improve your ability to understand and breakdown challenges. This solutions in this repo help you get better at that.

Every solution in this repo has a README that mirrors the solving process I would go through while working through an interview challenge. It starts with understanding the problem by rewriting it, then a manual solution is implemented, and finally a solution is coded using test cases.

## How to use it

1. Pick a challenge
2. Open up the challenge's README.md
3. Go to the original source of the problem
4. Work through the problem using the README as a reference

The process you go through should be like this;

1. Describe the problem
2. Do it manually
3. Figure out the data structures
